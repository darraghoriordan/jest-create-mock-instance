## NOTE: TEMPORARY FORKED VERSION FOR JEST 27+

This is a temporary fork of this library that allows it to work with Jest 27 and above while waiting for the maintainer to merge a fix.

The fix has been merged in the original now so please install that instead (https://github.com/asvetliakov/jest-create-mock-instance).
